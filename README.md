# RichRSS

An app I've been threatening to make for years.

RichRSS (which will likely get renamed if I ever decide to pop this in the App store for others to use) is an RSS Feed Reader for iOS. I love RSS, but I've never really been happy with other feed readers on small devices. I use, love, and pay for Silvio Rizzi's Reeder for my desktop devices. In some way, that app being so good, has inspired me to 'write' this.

Why the quotes around 'write'?

This README is the only file in this application that I, Rich -- a human -- is going to write. Everything else will be developed by LLMs. Primarily Claude, as I pay for that, and get a bunch of 'free' credits. But possibly other LLMs through Cursor, which I also pay for.

Why am I -- a software engineer of somewhere close to 20 years -- completely devolving responsibility to the robots?

In part because I don't speak Swift. In part because I want to test how good the current state of the art models are at making native applications. And in part because I'd like to (perhaps, and I'm not committed to this) see how much of a time-saver using LLMs like this really is. There's 2 ways I could do that 1) Find a willing iOS Developer to take a look at the app and its features and tell me how long it would take them to develop it and compare that to how long it has taken me or, perhaps better, and why I'm not committing to this, 2) Learn Swift and write the app myself.

A few evenings into development (this is very much a side project), I really can't quite believe how featured and 'polished' the app is out of the gate. We'll see how that pans out over time, and there's a laundry list of things I need to add, fix, make better, or polish. But this thing works, it's fairly pleasant to use, and all I did was type English into a box a few dozen times, and press cmd+shift+k and cmd+r in XCode (which Claude taught me how to do) about the same amount of times.

I'm really excited about tooling like this empowering people that have unimaginably cool app ideas in their heads, who "can't code", to turn those ideas into a tangible, real, working thing. Sure, right now, I think me having a decent amount of software development experience is helping me progress quickly with this, but I have zero doubts that it won't be long until that isn't necessary at all (if it even is now, I can't really know).

Ultimately, I'm building this app for me. But if you know how to download this thing from github, import it into Xcode, build it, and deploy it to your own phone (Claude can help, believe me), then I really hope you enjoy it.
